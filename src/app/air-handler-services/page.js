        What Is An Air Handler?
      </div>
      <div className=" text-sky-900 pb-2 px-2">
        The air handler is the part of your heating and cooling system that
        regulates and circulates the air through the ductwork. In traditional
        heating systems, the air handler is a component of the furnace. Heating
        systems that do not burn fuel to generate heat, such as heat pumps and
        geothermal systems, require a separate air handling unit to filter,
        regulate and circulate the air.

        Servicing And Maintaining The Air Handler
      </div>
      <div className=" text-sky-900 pb-2 px-2">
        Without the air handler, the heated or cooled air would not reach the
        various rooms in your home, making it a critical part of any heating and
        cooling system. It&apos;s extremely important to keep the air handler in
        good working order. The key to avoiding a possible breakdown of your air
        handler is to have it inspected and maintained on a regular basis by a
        professional.

        One thing that homeowners can do on their own that will greatly assist
        the function of the air handler is to regularly inspect and replace the
        air filter as needed. Doing so will prevent it from becoming clogged and
        forcing the air handler to work harder in an effort to propel the air
        into your home.
